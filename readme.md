# cycloidal ball reducer

I couldn't find a 3d printed ball reducer so I finally figured out how to make one.  

<shift>+s to open sketches and add ins.  I use vs code to run it.
  
Main params should be edited.  You can use this visualizer to play around with them for a preview https://github.com/Tomato1107/Cycloidal-Drive-Animation  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20271/174312023-cab0cbab-1996-4b46-a109-1278660e65d6.png)

  
Running the script produces 3 sketches; balls, eccentric moving track , fixed track
  
sketch 1: the balls

sketch 2: the moving eccentric disk

I used the center spline for the path for a sweep.  this creates the ball track.

 You also likely need to add a ball bearing cage like this:

  it is pretty much impossible to operate without this
